# Project: Modifying the DOM

Modify _script.js_ to enable the following functionality so that:
 * clicking on "Add paragraphs" shows p-div, hides img-div, and adds a new paragraph element to p-div containing text of your choice
 * clicking on "Add images" shows img-div, hides p-div, and adds a new image of your choice to img-div
